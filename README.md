## Description

This project was created in order to understand how all looting games are working.
This project could also be updated or not.

**_It has many flaws, it's just a personal project._**

## Principle

For each pull, we retrieve a list of 10 characters.
In each list -> we integrate as much character as their rarity in a 100-sized array.

For example :

- For a character with a 50% drop chance, we add 50 characters in this array.
- For a character with a 25% drop chance, we add 25 characters in this array
- etc etc ...

After creating this array, we randomly select 10 characters and this is our result !

If you liked this, don't forget to add a ðŸŒŸ ðŸ‘‹

## How to use it

    $ cd loot-table
    $ docker-compose up -d .

The last command will build everything under docker including the webapp and the database (it includes a Postgresql
image)
